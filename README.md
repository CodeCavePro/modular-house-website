The website for an architectural firm which designs, builds and sells modular houses.
The idea is to represent houses from all perspectives, so user can decide which one he'd like to build the most.

Website is developed on the hook based React, Material UI used for styling. MODX CMS was put on top of the React for managing content.
The website features Augmented Reality experience on mobile devices - users can try homes right at their prospective backyard.
It also has simple booking system - customers can rent one of the modular houses to estimate the quality of construction and decide how they like both exterior and interior.
